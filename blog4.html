  <p class="post-text1">Feeling overwhelmed, confused, and/or frustrated by the multitude of competing messages about how to best care for your skin on a daily basis? Our Skin Health Experts are here to help! At our Los Angeles skincare clinics, we’ve identified – and recommend – a simple (yes, we said simple!) 5-step routine that keeps skin healthy and beautiful at every age. And while it’s not as easy as splash water on your face and use a drugstore moisturizer, investing in an effective skincare regimen today ensures that you avoid premature aging, unnecessary irritation, and spending another second feeling overwhelmed about what’s best for you and your skin. We’ve got your five skincare routine steps down to a simple morning and evening regimen. </p>
  <p class="post-text">If you're ready to level up your daily skincare routine, these three essential products are a must: facial cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. If you’re over the age of 35 and committed to keeping skin looking as healthy, radiant, and fresh as possible as you age, you’ll want to add in a few additional skincare steps (exfoliate, hydrate, treat), which we’ll share as well in this blog. </p>
  <p class="post-text">As you start exploring skincare products, remember that quality counts. Especially in a minimalist skincare regimen, efficacious ingredients are essential to get the results you want. Read on to discover how these basic and upgraded skincare routines can level up your beauty regimen.</p>
  <h2 class="sub-heading">Step 1: Cleanse</h2>
  <p class="post-text">During the day, your skin goes through a lot. Dead skin cells form on the surface. Dirt, oils, and impurities collect there, too. This is why our Skin Health Experts recommend beginning and ending each day by washing your face with the right cleanser for your skin type or concern. By effectively and consistently cleansing your skin, you improve your ability to avoid clogged pores, breakouts, and premature aging. By making cleansing a part of your AM and PM skincare routine, you can help rid your skin of these irritants, and in return, keep it healthy-looking and glowing. Beginning your daily skincare routine with a clean base will allow the rest of your skincare products to soak in better and cause them to be more effective overall.</p>
  <p class="post-text">When choosing a facial cleanser, select one that works with all skin types, like the EXFOLIKATE® Cleanser Daily Foaming Wash. It’s expertly formulated with AHAs and fruit enzymes to effectively cleanse away dirt, oil, makeup, and other impurities while gently exfoliating to reveal a smoother-looking, glowing complexion and skin tone.</p>
  <h3 class="sub3-heading">Step 2: Exfoliate</h3>
  <p class="post-text">While exfoliation is not a required step in a basic skincare routine, we think once you understand the benefits, you’ll consider consistently adding it to your regimen. Our founder Kate refers to exfoliation as a “skin game changer” because it’s the most efficient and effective way to improve the look of skin. When you remove dead surface skin cells, skin appears more radiant. It’s also prepped to better absorb the rest of your skincare regimen because hardened dead skin cells no longer block penetration. This means every product and ingredient you use after exfoliating can penetrate the surface layers of your skin more deeply and be more effective. </p>
  <p class="post-text">Exfoliating literally takes just two minutes. You can choose to exfoliate twice a week using ExfoliKate Intensive, our clinic-inspired super facial that reveals improved texture, pores, and radiance in just two minutes. Or if you’ve got sensitive skin, try Liquid ExfoliKate®, our gentle daily toner that improves texture and tone. If using ExfoliKate® Intensive, we recommend using it in the shower as the steam helps open pores and enhance exfoliation. If your skin is sensitive and doesn’t respond well to exfoliation, consider using Liquid ExfoliKate®, which acts more like a toner and gently exfoliates without irritation. </p>
  <h3 class="sub3-heading">Step 3: Hydrate</h3>
  <p class="post-text">Want to see fine lines disappear in an instant? Don’t reach for a thick, heavy cream. Opt for a juicy dose of hydration with a product expertly formulated with Hyaluronic Acid to instantly smooth, firm and plump, making those visible lines and wrinkles all but disappear! While this is beyond a basic skincare step, it has such instantly transformative results that you may want to consider adding one minute to your AM and PM routine and hydrate your skin. Again, this might seem like a complicated step, but with the Kate Somerville DermalQuench collection, you bring home the power of a clinic Oxygen facial for boosted, refreshed-looking skin at home.</p>
  <h3 class="sub3-heading">Step 3.1: Treat</h3>
  <p class="post-text">Your final bonus skincare step? Treat skin to targeted TLC with a serum that’s expertly formulated to address specific needs. Looking to calm irritation or visibly reduce skin redness? We recommend investing in a serum like the DeliKate® Recovery Serum. Lightweight and fast-absorbing, this skincare product helps soothe stressed and sensitized skin. Or, switch things up and give your skin a boost of antioxidants, which visibly improves skin tone, texture, and clarity as it works to brighten the complexion.</p>
  <p class="post-text">Not sure what your skin's needs are? Search through our serums and treatments, and choose one that best resonates with your skin type. You can also book a virtual skin consultation with one of our trusted Skin Health Experts today!</p>
  <h3 class="sub3-heading">Step 3.2: Moisturize</h3>
  <p class="post-text">Now that you've cleansed, exfoliated, hydrated, and treated skin, it’s time to seal in all those efficacious ingredients with the right moisturizer for your skin type or skin need. Seeking a moisturizer that can turn back time? Add the Kate Somerville Wrinkle Warrior® 2-in-1 Plumping Moisturizer + Serum to your skincare routine. Lightweight and fast-absorbing, it works to smooth the look of fine lines and wrinkles while improving skin firmness. Need an effective age repair cream? Try KateCeuticals™ Total Repair Cream. It’s chock full of Peptides that firm, smooth, and restore skin. Have oily skin and want to avoid breakouts without over drying skin? Our Oil Free Moisturizer is expertly formulated to do just that! You can explore our website and find a moisturizer best suited for your skin. </p>
  <h3 class="sub3-heading">Step 5: Protect</h3>
  <p class="post-text">Now that you've loaded your skin up with antioxidants and moisture, it's time to protect it from the day ahead. When simplifying your skincare routine, don't ditch the sunscreen. Why? Sunscreen is a way to protect your skin cells and acts as armor against the outside world - especially harmful UV rays. Our Skin Health Experts stress the importance of sunscreen this way – if 80% of premature aging is caused by the sun, wouldn’t you apply SPF every day to prevent and protect your beautiful skin? (The answer is Yes!)</p>
  <p class="post-text">When choosing which sunscreen to incorporate into your basic skincare routine, we recommend applying sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. An SPF of 30 or higher will help protect your skin from premature aging and harmful irritants. Interested in learning how to brighten dark spots or prevent sun spots from surfacing later on? Look no further than a quality sunscreen to protect your skin.</p>
  <p class="post-text">Make the most out of your simple skincare routine by absorbing and deflecting the sun's UV rays with Daily Deflector Mineral Sunscreen. Expertly formulated, this sun care product hydrates and strengthens skin, helps protect from blue light, and is easy to apply!</p>
  <p class="post-text">Ready to transform your skincare routine by simply incorporating a gentle cleanser, effective exfoliator, soothing moisturizer, or protective mineral sunscreen? Start by adding in a few of the products above. Additionally, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and staying hydrated are additional ways that you can keep your skin healthy-looking as you age. When it comes to implementing recommendations from our skincare 101 for beginners guide, remember that it is not a one-size-fits-all market. Pay attention to your skin's unique needs and how it feels after each product is applied. If, after giving your skin a bit of time to adjust to a new product, it's still not working out, switch it! Seasonality, diet, and aging all contribute to your skin's health and may require you to switch up your products now and then.</p>
