    <p class="post-text1">Clean face? Check! Favorite Serums? Check! Daily application of sunscreen… and wait, what are those white blobs? </p>
    <p class="post-text">We all know that wearing sunscreen is a must at this point, so it’s not too surprising if some of you have started to notice small white blobs, or “pills,” occasionally forming after application. At the bare minimum, pilling is a waste of product, but it’s generally pretty frustrating as well. When something so integral to your daily routine causes such an unattractive result, it leaves you questioning what went wrong, and more importantly— how can it be prevented. So, let’s take a look at why these annoying pills form.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Does Sunscreen Pill?</h2>
    <p class="post-text">When creating a sunscreen, there are a few key elements that a formulator must keep in mind. For one, they’ll want it to lay down on the skin and create a uniform film, allowing the sunscreen agents to disperse evenly. They will also want to ensure it stays put and doesn’t migrate on the skin. This is important to maintain the consistent, uniform coverage necessary to pass SPF testing. So typically, certain ingredients are incorporated to form films on the skin to keep it in place. Once the film is formed (depending on which ingredients were used), any rubbing on the sunscreen can break the film up and create what looks like pilling. </p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Which Ingredients Cause Pilling?</h2>
    <p class="post-text">There are a few different ingredients to keep an eye out for when it comes to pilling. Gums are the most common (and easiest) film formers to use. Ingredients like guar gum, sclerotium gum, xanthan gum, and many others containing the word gum are commonly found in sunscreen. There are also polymers (like accolades, copolymers, or a variety of different silicone polymers) that are used to lock this film in place. </p>
    <p class="post-text">These ingredients do not pose a risk of pilling on their own, but rather when you’re applying sunscreen with other products like serums, moisturizers, or makeup. When pairing a sunscreen containing gums or polymers with another product containing gums or polymers, the two will grab onto each other or interact. Because they’re incompatible, this can lead to the dreaded pilling.</p>
    <p class="post-text">By either rubbing your sunscreen after application or incorporating additional products with polymers and gums, the sunscreen film can break up and form pills.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">How Can Pilling Be Prevented?</h2>
    <h3 class="sub3-heading">Weekly Exfoliation</h3>
    <p class="post-text">A thoughtful skincare routine is critical in creating a clean slate for all products to come. While pilling is, for the most part, a polymer interaction, texture from dirt or dead skin cells sitting on top of the skin can cause problems of their own. Dry skin, dead skin cells, and flaking skin can prevent sunscreen from being absorbed. This is why exfoliating one or two times a week is an excellent way to clear your skin and ensure maximum absorption of skincare products.</p>
    <h3 class="sub3-heading">Take A Closer Look At The Products You Use</h3>
    <p class="post-text">When trying to avoid pilling, it all comes down to selecting the right products and putting them together. Sometimes this means choosing which product you like better. If there’s a certain serum, moisturizer, or makeup product that you can’t go without, but it interacts with your sunscreen, you may need to look for a sunscreen that doesn’t contain the same gums or polymers. The same goes for if there’s a sunscreen you can’t live without. Unfortunately, there’s not much to do about that gum-on-gum interaction besides rotating through different products and determining which ones are compatible. Like so many things in skincare, learning what works best for your unique skin comes down to trial and error.</p>
    <h4 class="sub4-heading">Seek Out Trusted Brands With Rigorous Testing Procedures</h4>
    <p class="post-text">I’ve been the head of product development for my skincare line for over 27 years, and this has really taught me that following proper product testing procedures is key to ensuring a good user experience.</p>
    <p class="post-text">For example, I just recently began testing a new moisturizer for my line. One thing I always look at when formulating skincare products is to see how they react with other products. In this case, that means testing this moisturizer with every single serum in my line so that when it’s all said and done, I can confidently say all of our products work together without the risk of pilling. Lo and behold, I did run into a pilling problem with one of our serums, and guess what—I had to go back to rework the formula. Now this is all totally normal but essential for providing a product that not only does what it says it’s going to do but also provides a great user experience (and definitely no pilling!). </p>
    <p class="post-text">While I can never be sure how a product will react with another outside of my line, it’s my mission to do as much as humanly possible in terms of testing formulas, ingredients, different viscosities, and anything else necessary to ensure a good interaction.</p>
